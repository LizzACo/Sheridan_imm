    Additional information
    Note: This program was formerly named Interactive Multimedia.
    Creative innovation and problem solving typify all interactive multimedia courses at Sheridan.
    Students acquire valuable experience by working in small, collaborative groups using agile development to manage a complete project through all phases â€” needs analysis, problem solving, rapid prototyping, user experience design and development.
    Classes are small and intimate, ensuring plenty of direct student-instructor interaction. There's no better place to prepare for an interactive media career. Come see why Sheridan is widely recognized as the best.
    Successful graduates may find employment with multimedia and web development companies; advertising agencies and new media companies; corporate environments (including creative, technical, marketing and training divisions); the increasingly important freelance market; education and government agencies; installation projects and the entertainment industry.
